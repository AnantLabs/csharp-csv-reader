Want to get started?  Here are a few walkthroughs.

== Read Into Data Table ==

The simplest way to get started is to read a file on disk into memory as a DataTable.  Here's how you do it:

 // This code assumes the file is on disk, and the first row of the file
 // has the names of the columns on it
 DataTable dt = CSVReader.LoadDataTable(myfilename);

== Iterate Through A Massive File ==

When you receive a gigantic 20GB file that is formatted CSV, you obviously can't parse it all into memory at once.  Here's how you do that:

 using (CSVReader cr = new CSVReader(myfilename, delim, qual)) {
     foreach (string[] line in cr.Lines()) {
         // Do whatever you want with this one line - the buffer will
         // only hold a small amount of memory at once, so you can 
         // iterate at your own pace!
     }
 }

== Output a Data Table ==

If you've got a datatable and want to put it on disk in a particular location, you can use the extension method to write it 

 DataTable dt;
 dt.SaveAsCSV(myfilename, true);

== Hand Roll Your Own ==

The class CSV contains a lot of useful functions for hand rolling your own CSV related code.  Pay special attention to TryParseLine() - it's the core of the project.
